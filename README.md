# `amalgamator` 

## Description

`amalgamator` is a set/map like data structure that allows you to combine members of the set/map together based on some criteria. 

This is useful when you want to merge objects together that aren't strictly equal, but are similar enough that you want to treat them as the same object.

## Installation

```bash
cargo add amalgamator
```

### Serde Support

If you want to use `serde` support, you can enable the `serde` feature.

```bash
cargo add amalgamator --features serde
```
